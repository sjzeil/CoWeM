External document references:

You can do an ordinary link as
   \href{URL}{some text}

All labels in LaTeX documents are added as bookmarks to the PDF file, so you can do:
    document1.tex:   \section{Introduction}\label{intro}
    document2.tex:   As explained \href{URLOfDocument1#intro}{here}
And if you know page numbers, you can do
    document2.tex:   As explained \href{URLOfDocument1#page.5}{here}

Be aware, however, that not all browser/PDF viewr combinations will
process the # part of a URL when openign a PDF file. In particular,
Android (and Apple?) devices don't seem to handle that.

For documents being created under the Public directory, you can do 
    \doclink{docName}{some text}
to create a link to the indicated "sibling" document in the same format as the
linking document (i.e., all 10-16x10 PDFs link to one another).

 \olink{docName}{labelWithinThatDocument}{some text} 
is my attempt to circumvent the fact that # linking does not always
work by typesettign a page number as part of the visible link,
allowing people to know what page you want them to go to.

This only works for "sibling" Public documents. To set this up, you need to put
   \references{docName}
into the file documentName.ext.tex.  You also need to make sure that
the external document has been processed before the one that
references it.

===============

Internal references:

Use \hyperlink{label}{some text} to link to anchors that have been marked as
\hypertarget{label}{target text, possibly empty} or as 
\hyperlabel[some text, possibly empty]{label}

Avoid the label= option of beamer frames. It doesn't work at all in article mode. Create hypertargets within the slides instead.

hyperlabel creates a hypertarget and a label and a special label for
use when assmbling multiple documents into a combined book. When used 
with slides with overlays, will produce messages about duplicate labels
(but should still work).

You can also use the old LaTeX \ref to get a hyperlinked section number.
\nameref works as well, but is not hyperlinked in slide mode. 

A test:
