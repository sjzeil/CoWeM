Some Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) about registering for on-line
and distance learning courses.


# Why won't LEO let me enroll in your class? Can I get an override?


There are several reasons why the automated LEO registration system
might refuse to let you into a class. As rule, course instructors will
need to know what the problem is before they can issue an override for
you or before they are even able to decide if they are willing to do
so.


1. You might be trying to register for a section at
   the [wrong site or room][webrooms] based upon your
   registration status at ODU.

2. The course section might be [full][caps]. Note that this
      [might change][fullsections] later in the registration period.

3. The course has co-requisites (e.g., a required lab or recitation
   section), you need to register for those at the same time you
   register for the main section. Review the course syllabus and
   on-line catalog listings to see what those might be.

4. Your records at ODU may indicate that you lack one or more of the
   [prerequisites](#prereq) of the course. Review the course syllabus
   and on-line catalog listings to see what those might be.


If LEO refuses to allow you to register, it generally gives some
indication as to which of the above is the problem. If you ask an
instructor to override LEO and let you into the course, they will have
to ask you what LEO indicated the problems was. Instructors really
cannot enter a blanket override for all possible registration issues.




# Why does LEO tell me "Student campus does not match course campus."? [campusMatch]

When you enrolled at ODU, you were assigned a home "campus" depending
on whether you were a local student or a distance student.  You have
tried to register for a site that does not match that "campus". You
need to pick the course section whose [site or room name][webrooms]
matches your home location (or you need to contact the Registrar's
office about getting your campus designation changed).

# Where are the rooms "web hr", " web va", and "web nonva"? [webrooms]

In fact these are not rooms at all. These codes are used with "pure"
web courses that commonly do not have regularly scheduled meeting times.

A course section listed in "web hr" is open to enrollment to anyone on
the Norfolk campus or at one of the four Higher Educ. Centers
(Virginia Beach, Peninsula, Tri-Cities, and Northern Virginia). A
section listed as "web va" is open to anyone else in Virginia, and
"web nonva" denotes a section open to distance students outside
Virginia.

  

# Where are the rooms "web2", " web5", and "web7"? [websites]

These are older names for ["web hr", " web va", and "web nonva"][webrooms].



# Why does LEO say the course is closed when some sections still have seats available? [overallCap]

Distance courses that are offered in multiple geographic sections are
subject to an overall cap on enrollment as well as caps on the
individual sections. If the overall course is full, you will not be
able to register for _any_ section, even if that section did not
reach its individual cap.




# Why are enrollments capped in CS Distance Learning  courses? [enrollmentLimits]

When we offer a regular on-campus course, enrollment is
limited by physical factors such as classroom size and
by our own estimates of how many students can be supported by a
single instructor before the quality of instruction begins to degrade.

Distance courses, especially web-based courses, are even more
sensitive than conventional courses to the instructor's ability to
respond promptly to individual student's questions and problems.  An
on-line course may be divided into dozens of sections, each associated
with a different site or geographic region.  Obviously, if each site
were to register as many students as go into a normal on-campus class,
the instructor's ability to respond to individual students would be
drastically reduced.

To preserve the quality of instruction in web-based courses, the CS
Dept. has adopted the simple guideline of limiting distance course
enrollments to the same limits that we would impose on an on-campus
course. To do otherwise would, we believe, compromise the educational
experience offered to the distance students.

# Why are the caps at my site so small? [caps]

To allow students at each site equal access to our offerings, we place
caps on each site's section enrollment so that no one site can
monopolize the course during the early enrollment period. (Not all
sites conduct registration at the same time, so a simple first-come,
first-served policy is not considered fair.)


As the registration period progresses, adjustments may be made in
these caps as it becomes clear that demand for the course is higher at
some sites than at others. If the total demand for a course at all
sites exceeds the overall enrollment cap, we look into alternatives
such as finding additional instructors or additional resources to
support a higher enrollment load, but this may not be possible
(particularly if the situation does not become apparent until late in
the scheduling and enrollment process).

 
# I want to enroll in a CS on-line course but the section is full. What do I do? [fullsections]

First, if you are a Norfolk student or a student at one of the ODU
Higher Education Centers in the Hampton Roads area, and if it is still
the first several weeks of registration, just wait.  As explained
[above][caps], enrollment caps at these sites start small to give
other sites some opportunity to register for the course) but are often
relaxed after the first several weeks of registration.


Let your adviser know that you are trying to get into the course. For
Norfolk and Higher Ed. Center students, contact the CS Dept
advisers. Students at more distant sites should contact their academic
adviser. We try to respond to enrollment pressures as well as we can
(there's no incentive for us to turn students away!) but we need to
learn from the advisers which sections are in the most demand.


You can email the instructor asking to be admitted. Don't be surprised
if you don't hear back immediately. Your request may go into
a waiting list until the overall picture of enrollment pressure
becomes clearer.  (In fact, a quick response is
almost bound to be a negative.) You should indicate any special
reasons why the instructor should admit you even though they are
turning down similar requests from many other people. Factors to
explain include:

* Is this course required for your major?
* How close are you to graduating? What would the impact on your
  degree progress be if you failed to get this course?
* If other sections of this course are available and have open seats,
  why can't you register for one of them?
* Were there legitimate reasons why you failed to register earlier,
  before the course filled up?


# I don't officially have the prerequisites. Can I get a waiver? [prereq]


If you think that ODU records about you are incorrect or incomplete
for some reason, and that you have other courses and/or experience
that are equivalent to the prerequisites, contact the course
instructor and explain why you believe that you do have the background
required to succeed in the course.



You need to make your case clearly and may need to back it up with
details. For example, titles of courses you have taken may not be
enough. You may need a syllabus and/or outline of the course to make
your case.

Don't be upset if the instructor is skeptical. We don't want to set up
a student for failure by admitting them to a course where they are
unlikely to succeed.


If you are uncertain about whether your background is sufficient to
take the course, search around and see if the website from prior
semesters' offerings are available.  Look for both the course you are
trying to get into and for the pre-requisite courses. Find out what
those prerequisite courses actually teach and what is expected of
students at the beginning of the next course.  If the instructor
believes that you are making an _informed_ assessment of your own
chances in the course, he or she is much more likely to agree to a
waiver.
