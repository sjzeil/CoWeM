Title: Protected Directory

This directory is set aside for content that, in a course that is otherwise open to the world, 
holds content that is restricted to selected viewers  (e.g., students enrolled in the course).

When deploying on an Apache-style server, you can add a .htaccess file to this directory to
enforce such restrictions independent of the rest of the website.

If you are deploying to a server that authenticates and limits all viewers,  
(e.g., a Blackboard content area), then you may ignore this directory altogether.
