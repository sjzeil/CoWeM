<pre><code>## Finite Automata

**Overview**
    
 A finite automaton (FA) is a mathematical model of a machine that
 switches among a limited number of different states each time it is
 fed a new piece of input.
    
    
 This is the most basic and the least powerful of the automata that we
 will examine this semester. It is, however, still capable of
 performing a variety of useful tasks, and its very simplicity makes
 it something that many people can work with intuitively.
    
      
**Objectives**

* Understand the basic definitions and concepts of finite
     automata and how they can be used to recognize languages.
       
* Construct FAs for some simple languages and determine what
     strings a given FA will accept. 
       
* Apply the pumping lemma to determine what languages can be
     recognized by finite automata.
       
* Modify a FA to minimize the number of states.
       
      
**Relevance**

    
 Despite their simplicity, finite automata can process a number of
 useful languages.  Because of their simplicity, programmers find FAs
 intuitive enough that they are often used to model high-level
 behaviors in large systems and in complicated programs (even though
 FAs are not powerful enough to model program behaviors in general.)

&#x22ee; 

## Regular Expressions

**Overview**
    
 For every interesting group of automata, there is a corresponding set
 of languages that can be recognized by those automata. In this
 module, we examine the regular languages, the set of languages
 recognized by FAs. We look at regular expressions, a common notation
 for describing such languages, and one that should already be
 familiar to most students.
    
    
 Moving back and forth between FAs and their corresponding regular
 expressions is easier if we allow the FA to be in multiple states
 simultaneously. This leads us to the idea of non-determinism. We will
 distinguish between deterministic FAs (DFAs) and non-deterministic
 FAs (NFAs) and will explore how to convert from one to the other.
    
      
**Objectives**

* Read and write regular expressions for desired regular languages.
       
* Construct NFAs corresponding to a regular expression and
     regular expressions describing a given NFA.
       
* Convert NFAs to DFAs.
       
      
**Relevance**

    
 Regular expressions are pervasive in programming. They are a common
 tool in string searching, and students should recall their
 introduction in CS252 for that purpose. They are popular enough to be
 included in the standard libraries for both C++ and Java.
    
    
 Regular expressions are also widely employed in programming language
 compilers. The first phase of a typical compiler (the "scanner" or
 "lexical analyzer") compresses the input by reducing a string of
 characters to a string of tokens. Those tokens are typically
 recognized by a FA, which may have thousands of states. Compiler
 developers use automated tools to generate these FAs from a
 collection of regular expressions.

</blockquote><h3 id="activities">2.1.3 Activities</h3><p>The core content of the outline is a list of activities in each of the undivided sections.</p>
    <p>The activities are introduced by a horizontal rule in the section (typed in Markdown as a line containing three hyphens).</p>
    <p>The activities are placed in ordered (numbered) lists. (Remember that Markdown will renumber the items, so the exact number you type are not important.) You can have multiple numbered lists in a section, separated by a simple a paragraph.</p>
    <p>Here is an example of a complete section of a course outline , with multiple activities:</p>

    <p>In the <em>modules</em> format, if the text part of the fake link is blank (must have at least 1 blank character), then the presentation table (described <a href="#presentation">below</a> is checked to see if there is a standard prefix for that “kind”.
