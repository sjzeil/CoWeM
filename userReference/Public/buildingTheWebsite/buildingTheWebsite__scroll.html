    <p>Gradle is a build manager for software projects. Although a websiote may not involvr programming in the usual sense, it can certainly be regarded as a software system. If ypur only experience with with build managers has been the ones built in to a programming IDE or the venerable Unix <code>make</code> utility, you may be surprised at the range of features provided by Gradle. Of particular relevance to CoWeM:</p>
    <ul>
  <li>
  <p>Gradle allows the steps involved in a build, such as copying and and manipulation of files, to be described and performed in in a portable (not dependent on a specific operating system) manner.</p>
    </li>
  <li>
  <p>Gradle can fetch and incorporate software packages needed for the build from over the internet,  and can check periodically for updates to those packages.</p>
    </li>
  <li>
  <p>The ability to fetch needed software packages extends to Gradle itself, so by including a few small  files in each copy of a CoWeM course, the Gradle build system can be bootstrapped on to any Linux,  Windows, or OS/X machine with a reasonably up-to-date Java environment (JRE).</p>
    </li>
  <li>
    <p>Gradle can be extended, teaching it new processes for different kinds of projects, via a <em>plugin</em> system.</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>CoWeM is, in fact, implemented as a package of related Gradle plugins.</li>
    </ul>

</div><p>The files <code>gradlew</code> , <code>gradlew.bat</code>, and <code>gradlew-gui.bat</code> are scripts that are used to launch the gradle build manager to request building the website. The <code>.bat</code> files are for Windows. The simple <code>gradlew</code> file is used for both Linux and OS/X. </p>
    <p>The first time that you run one of these on a given machine, it will download the actual Gradle build manager and install it in your personal account area (Look for a <code>.gradle</code> directory in your user home directory.) It will then proceed to download the latest version of CoWeM and of the various software libraries used by CoWeM. This software is stored in a cache (within the afore-mentioned <code>.gradle</code>directory). Items in the cache expire periodically (typically after 24 hours), so that Gradle will check at intervals to see if any of that software has been updated.</p>
    <p>Gradle can be run in a command-line mode or a GUI mode. </p>
    <h2 id="windows">1.1 Windows</h2><p>To run in command-line mode, open a <code>cmd</code> window, <code>cd</code> to your course root directory, and run</p>
    <p><code>gradlew</code> <em>target</em></p>
    <p>The possible <em>targets</em> are discussed in the next section.</p>
    <p>To run in GUI mode, do the same and run</p>
    <p><code>gradlew-gui</code></p>
    <p>or simply view the course root root directory in the Windows File Explorer and double-click the <code>gradle-gui.bat</code> file.</p>
    <h2 id="linux">1.2 Linux</h2><p>To run in command-line mode, open a terminal window, <code>cd</code> to your course root directory, and run</p>

    <p>In GUI mode, Gradle displays a list of possible build targets (in the top panel), which will include those discussed in the next section plus a variety of “generic” Gradle targets.</p>
    <p>You can click on any of them to select it, then click the small green “run” button at the top of the upper panel to execute that target. </p>

  <dt>build</dt>
  <dd>Build the website by processing the document sets. The resulting website  can be found in the directory <code>build/website</code> (under the course root  directory). You can use your favorite web browser “Open File” command to  view any of the HTML files that have been generated.</dd>
</dl><p>The <code>build</code> target is the default. If you don’t specify a target at the command line, <code>build</code> is run.</p>
    <dl>
  <dt>pdf</dt>
  <dd>Build the website by processing the document sets. If the <code>Directory/outline</code>  document exists and has been generated in scroll format, it and all primary  documents linked from it (that also have scroll formats) are combined  into a single document and used to produce PDF summaries of the website  suitable, with some limitations, for reading off-line.
    <p>PDFs can be generated in a variety of page sizes. By default, generated PDFs are</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>A <a href="../../letter.pdf">letter</a> page (8.5 in by 11in) version</li>
      <li>A <a href="../../4x3.pdf">4x3</a> page format for larger tablets.</li>
      <li>An <a href="../../8x5.pdf">8x5</a> page format for tables designed for viewing “wide-screen” video.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The generated PDFs are placed in the root directory of the website.</p>
    
    <p>PDF generation is only avilable on machines with the <code>npm</code> program for retrieving Javascrip modules. </p>
    
  </dd>
  <dt>clean</dt>
  <dd>Delete all files that can be reconstructed via the <code>build</code> target. This is  done by deleting the entire <code>build</code> directory.

    <p>There are several ways to do this:</p>
    <ul>
  <li>
  <p>If working in the Gradle GUI, you will see your CoWem groups as expandable  items in the list of targets. Expanding one of those groups will give you a  list of the document sets in that group. Expand one of those document sets  and you can select a target to be applied to that document set.</p>
    </li>
  <li>
    <p>Working at the command line, if you <code>cd</code> into the document set directory,  you can specify the build targets just as you would at the top. The one  caution is that you must invoke <code>gradlew</code> via the path back to the  document root. For example, to rebuild a course syllabus, you might do</p>
    
    <pre><code>cd Public/syllabus
../../gradlew build 
</code></pre>
  </li>
</ul><p>in Linux or OS/X. In Windows, you would do the same excpet using “" instead  of ”/".</p>
    <ul>
  <li>Working at the command line, but <code>cd</code>’d into the course root directory, you  can specify a target on a specific document set using the format  <code>:</code>_group_<code>:</code>_documentset_<code>:</code>_target_. For example, to rebuild a course  syllabus you could say
    <pre><code>./gradlew :Public:syllabus:build
</code></pre>
  </li>
</ul><p>The targets that can be launched for a single document set are:</p>
    <dl>
  <dt>build</dt>
  <dd>Same as the yop-level <code>build</code> target, but builds only the  indicated document set.</dd>
  <dt>deployDoc</dt>
  <dd>Like the top-level <code>deploy</code>, this builds the document set and copies it  to the appropriate deployment directory on the same machine.</dd>
  <dt>deployDocBySsh</dt>
  <dd>Like the top-level <code>deployBySsh</code>, this builds the document set and copies it  to a remote machine via secure shell.</dd>
  <dt>deployDocByRsync</dt>

      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Select <code>Content Areas</code> and <code>Navigation Settings</code> to update  course content (<code>bb</code> packages) and the Blackboard navigation  bar (both <code>bb</code> and <code>bbthin</code>).</p>
    
        <p><div class="noFloat"> </div>
    <img src="importPackage3.png" style="float: right; max-width: 67%;"/>  Entries from your CoWeM navigation document will be added to  the main Blackboard course navigation bar. For a fat <code>bb</code>  package, these entries will point to the copy of the website  uploaded into the course Content Collection area. For the  <code>bbthin</code> package, these entries will point to the “real”  external website indicated by your course’s <code>baseURL</code>  parameter. </p>
    
      </li>
    </ul> No other entries in this area will have any effect.
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Click “Submit”. Blackboard will upload the package you specified and  will queue up a background job to process it.</p>
    
    <p>Processing typically takes several minutes, but can take quite a long time if you have a very large website or if many other people have background jobs queued. (For example, requests to copy materials from one Blackboard course to another are also handled as background jobs, and are quite common in the weeks leading up to a new semester.)</p>
    
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>After the import has completed, you may want to rearrange the new navigation  bar entries. (New entries are always added to the bottom of the bar.)</p>
