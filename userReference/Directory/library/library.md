Title: Reference Materials

# Markdown

There are many dialects of Markdown

* CoWem uses [PegDown](https://github.com/sirthias/pegdown), which unfortunately
  lacks a comprehensive description of its accepted syntax.
  
* It's probably closest to [MultiMarkdown](http://fletcherpenney.net/multimarkdown/),
  which has a convenient [syntax cheat sheet](https://rawgit.com/fletcher/human-markdown-reference/master/index.html)
  
# Other Document Processing

* Mathematics support is via [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/)
    * MathJax allows Cowem to support mathematics typed in either
      [LaTeX](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Mathematics) style 
      or [AsciiMath](http://asciimath.org/).   
    * MathJax has a [live demo page](https://www.mathjax.org/#features),
      which can be a convenient way to try out math expressions.
      
* Syntax highlighting (coloring) of program source code is provided
  via [HighlightJS](http://highlightjs.org/).  

  
# Building

* CoWeM is implemented as a collection of [Gradle](https://gradle.org) plugins.

* The CoWeM project itself resides
    [here](https://git-community.cs.odu.edu/zeil/Course_Website_Management).
