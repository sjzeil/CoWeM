# Preamble


<img src="graphics:cowem64.png" align="left"/>

This is the users' documentation for 
[CoWeM](https://git-community.cs.odu.edu/zeil/Course_Website_Management)
(Course Websites from Markdown). 

CoWeM is a system for for building course websites, including lecture notes,
slides & organizational pages, from Markdown documents. You can see examples of
these websites linked from [my home page](http://www.cs.odu.edu/~zeil),
including the course sites for CS 250, 330, 333, 350, 361, and 382.

Course content can be portrayed in various HTML-based formats, including
single and multi-page documents and slides. Conditional text allows a single
Markdown document to serve as the source for both a full set of lecture notes
with explanations and a sparser set of slides. Support is provided for
automatic pretty-printing of program source code and for the rendering of
mathematics from LaTeX expressions.

This content can be deployed as an ordinary website or as an export package
suitable for importing into Blackboard or other Learning Management Systems.
