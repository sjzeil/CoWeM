# Preamble


<img src="graphics:cowem64.png" align="left"/>

This is the users' documentation for 
[CoWeM](https://git-community.cs.odu.edu/zeil/Course_Website_Management)
(Course Websites from Markdown). 

CoWeM is a system for for building course websites, including lecture notes,
slides & organizational pages, from Markdown documents.

CoWeM has been used to support both traditional face-to-face and web
courses.  A partial list appears on the [Example Sites](doc:examples) page.
This user reference site is also generated using CoWem.


Course content can be portrayed in various HTML-based formats, including
single and multi-page documents and slides. Conditional text allows a single
Markdown document to serve as the source for both a full set of lecture notes
with explanations and a sparser set of slides. Support is provided for
automatic pretty-printing of program source code and for the rendering of
mathematics from LaTeX expressions.

This content can be deployed as an ordinary website or as an export package
suitable for importing into Blackboard or other Learning Management Systems.

a notation designed
for easy typing in an ordinary text editor.
