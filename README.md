# Course Website Management

This is a suite of scripts, graphics, style sheets & build files that
I use to generate and maintain my course websites.  You can see
examples of these websites linked from my
[home page](http://www.cs.odu.edu/~zeil/), including the course sites
for CS 250, 330, 333, 350, 361, and 382.

The primary input document format for course content is markdown --
specifically [multimarkdown](http://fletcherpenney.net/multimarkdown/). 

Course content can be portrayed in various HTML-based formats,
including single and multi-page documents, slides, and e-pub and mobi
ebooks.

This content can be deployed as an ordinary website or as a Common
Cartridge export package suitable for importing into Blackboard or other
Learning Management Systems.
