# CoWeM: Course Websites from Markdown

CoWeM is a static site generator for for building course websites, including lecture notes, 
slides & organizational pages, from Markdown documents. The CoWeM system itself is a small
collection of Gradle plug-ins and associated support libraries.

Course content can be portrayed in various HTML-based formats,
including single and multi-page documents and slides. Conditional text allows
a single Markdown document to serve as the source for both a full set of lecture
notes with explanations and a sparser set of slides.  Support is provided
for automatic pretty-printing of program source code and for the rendering
of mathematics from LaTeX expressions.

This content can be deployed as an ordinary website or as a 
SCORM package suitable for importing into Blackboard or other
Learning Management Systems.

* The CoWeM system itself is a small collection of Gradle plug-ins and
  associated support libraries.  Courses built in CoWeM include a small
  set of files that will "bootstrap" the fetching of CoWeM code and the
  Gradle build manager onto nearly any system with a working Java runtime
  environment without requiring a special installation procedure.
