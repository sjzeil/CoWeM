# Preamble

**Welcome to CS333**

*   Each module consists of a series of activities.
    * Not every assigned activity requires you to submit 
        something for grading. Nonetheless, you are expected to
        do them all.

    *       If no due date is specified, you are supposed to complete the 
        assigned activity by the end of the final day allotted for
        that part of the course.



**KEYS TO SUCCESS IN THIS COURSE:**

*   READ THE SYLLABUS 

      The syllabus lays out the basic course policies. It tells
      you what you need to do to earn a passing grade. It tells
      you when you need to have done that by. It tells you how to
      get in touch with me if you run into problems.


*   HAVE A SCHEDULE

      You have the freedom to schedule your own time in this
      course, but you _DO_ need to set up a schedule. Don't
      forget that this course exists and that you are registered
      for it. Don't think you can repeatedly set it aside for
      weeks at a time and make up the time later.

*   IF YOU DON"T UNDERSTAND SOMETHING, ASK QUESTIONS

      In a web course, my role as Instructor changes from
      "lecturer" to "tutor". You can ask questions in the course
      Forums.  You can send me email. You can also contact me
      during office hours. You'll find more information on these
      options in the syllabus and other documents on the Course
      Policies page.

      Some people are too shy to ask questions. Some are too proud
      to ask questions. My advice to both groups is to get over
      it! Part of being educated is knowing how to exploit your
      available information resources. In this course, I am one of
      those resources.
