# CoWeM: Course Websites from Markdown

CoWeM is a static site generator for for building course websites, including lecture notes, 
slides & organizational pages, from Markdown documents. 

CoWeM is a small collection of Gradle plug-ins and associated support libraries.

CoWeM has been used to support both traditional face-to-face and web courses, 
examples of which can be found [here](./examples.html).

The primary input document format for course content is Markdown --
specifically [multimarkdown](http://fletcherpenney.net/multimarkdown/). 

Course content can be portrayed in various HTML-based formats,
including single and multi-page documents and slides. Conditional text allows
a single Markdown document to serve as the source for both a full set of lecture
notes with explanations and a sparser set of slides.  Support is provided
for automatic pretty-printing of program source code and for the rendering
of mathematics from LaTeX expressions.

This content can be deployed as an ordinary website or as a
SCORM package suitable for importing into Blackboard or other
Learning Management Systems.
