Title: Offline Viewing

To facilitate off-line viewing, the lecture notes and labs have been
collected into ebook format. They are available in both `epub` and
`mobi` format.

| Formatted for... |  |
|------------------|------|
| Kindle           | [mobi](../../@courseName@.mobi) |
| Other e-readers  | [epub](../../@courseName@.epub) |




If your e-reader can handle either `epub` or `mobi` formats, you are
probably better off trying the `epub` format. (The `mobi` format is
created by conversion from the `epub`.)

Of course, there are compromises involved in going to an e-book
format.

* If you have a black-and-white E-ink device, you won't see
color. (I have added visual markers to my common color based
highlighting).

* No source code syntax coloring - I use Javascript to do that and
  e-readers do not, in general, support Javascript.

* For similar reasons, I had to render any mathematics in a different
  matter. Math might not re-scale if you change font size.

* Links to material within the ebook should work. Links to material on
  the original website or elsewhere on the web might not.
  
* Some devices are quite narrow and may have problems rending entire
  lines of code, to say nothing of items I intended to place
  side-by-side.

    (You may do better to read in landscape mode).

    * Oddly, some e-readers for desktop PCs insist on formatting the
      book into narrow columns no matter how wide you make the window.


# Ebook Readers

Ebook readers are not as standardized as web browsers, so you may need
to experiment with different viewers and viewer settings to find one
that works for you. 

In particular, there are two general approaches taken by ebook
readers:

* Some try to follow the formatting directions (CSS) given in the book as
  faithfully as their rendering engine permits.


* Others try to provide a uniform reading experience for all books by
  overriding the book's own CSS and substituting a uniform set of
  fonts, background colors, etc.

    This is fine if you are reading typical fiction work, where all
    you need is things arranged into paragraphs with an occasional
    section title and picture. But it's not so good for technical
    reading if the e-reader decides to ignore highlighted areas of
    text or to remove all indentation and line breaks from a block of
    source code.

    Some of these readers can be switched back and forth from book
    formatting mode to reader-preferred mode.


## Comments on Specific E-Readers


All of the following are free.

Some offer related functionality that you
may find useful (note taking, bookmarks, synchronization across
platforms, etc.)


### Follows Book Formatting (CSS)

* [EPUBReader](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/epubreader/)
    plugin for Firefox, (Win, OSX, Linux)

* [Readium](http://readium.org)  plugin for Chrome, (Win, OSX, Linux)


* [Calibre](http://calibre-ebook.com/), an OK e-reader, but more
    oriented towards organizing large libraries of ebooks (Win, OSX, Linux)


* [Apple iBooks](http://www.apple.com/ibooks/), (OSX, iOS)

* [Adobe Digital Editions](http://www.adobe.com/products/digital-editions/download.html), 
  (Win, OSX), will not render many of the Unicode characters
  that I use regularly,


### Substitutes Own Formatting




*  [Kindle](https://kindle.amazon.com/) (device, Win, OSX, iOS,
   Android, Linux), some versions support switching to book CSS mode

* [Nook](http://www.barnesandnoble.com/u/nook-mobile-apps/379003593/),
    (Win, OSX)

* [Moon+](http://www.moondownload.com/), (Android), can be switched to
  book CSS mode, but has some bugs (e.g., cannot move to next chapter
  without switching mode back to its own formatting).

* [fbreader](http://fbreader.org/), (Android, Win, OSX, Linux)

* [Aldiko](http://www.aldiko.com/), (Android)
